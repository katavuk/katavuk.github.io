Hi! I'm Kata, a postdoc at the [Faculty for Informatics and Data Science](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/informatics-data-science/faculty/home/index.html) at the [University of Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/en). 

In 2023 I completed my PhD at the [Faculty of Mathematics](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/) at [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en) under the supervision of [Herold Dehling](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ffm/Lehrstuehle/Lehrstuhl-XII/dehling.html). 

In June 2023, I joined the University of Regensburg as a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning working with [Merle Behr](https://merlebehr.org).

My research primarily focuses on interpretable and personalized machine learning, along with change-point analysis, applied within the fields of biomedicine, genetics, and the wider natural sciences. As a member of [Transregio 374](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/biologie-vorklinische-medizin/sfb1350/crc-1350/index.html) within the project _Platforms for Bioinformatics Methodology and Genepriorization,_ I am working on ensemble tree-based methods for gene prioritization for kidney-related diseases.
