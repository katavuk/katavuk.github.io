I have started a new position as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Regensburg! Iâ€™ll be working at the Faculty of Informatics and Data Science in the [Machine Learning Group](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/informatik-data-science/maschinelles-lernen-behr/startseite/index.html) led by Merle Behr. I am excited to contribute to this dynamic field and explore innovative approaches in statistical machine learning. :rocket:
