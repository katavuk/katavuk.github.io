I’m proud to announce that I have officially **earned my PhD**. It was a special experience made even better by having my family and friends there to celebrate with me. :mortar_board:

I have started a **new position** as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Regensburg! I’ll be working at the Faculty of Informatics and Data Science in the [Machine Learning Group](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/informatik-data-science/maschinelles-lernen-behr/startseite/index.html) led by Merle Behr. I am excited to contribute to this dynamic field and explore innovative approaches in statistical machine learning. :rocket:
