**01/2026** 🇨🇦 I’m excited to kick off the year in Montreal, Canada, with a research stay at McGill University.

2025
-
**12/2025 🎙️ Invited Talk at ICSDS:** I ended the year with a talk at the IMS International Conference on Statistics and Data Science in Seville, which was also a great opportunity for inspiring exchanges.

**12/2025 📄 New Preprint:** Our paper “Provable Recovery of Locally Important Signed Features and Interactions from Random Forests” (with Merle Behr and Nicolas Ihlo) is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11081). 

**09/2025 🇨🇦 Visiting Scholar Funding:** I’m very happy to share that I received a fellowship for the [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/) Visiting Scholar Program. I will join IVADO and McGill University in Montréal as a Visiting Scholar for four months, from January to April 2026. I’m really looking forward to this stay.

**05/2025 🎙️ Ivited Talk and Keynote:** I'm looking forward to giving two invited talks next month - one at the workshop [Statistical Theory of Neural Networks](https://sites.google.com/view/stnnworkshop/home) and a keynote at the conference [Women In Data Science](https://www.wids-regensburg.de/speakers-2025/). 

**03/2025 Workshop Announcement:** Excited to announce the upcoming workshop [Probability Theory and its Applications](https://sites.google.com/view/workshop-prob-and-apps-2025), which will take place on July 3–5, 2025, at Ruhr University Bochum. Together with my colleagues [Annika Betken](https://annikabetken.github.io) and [Marie-Christine Düker](https://mariedueker.github.io), I am organizing this event in honor of our PhD supervisor [Herold Dehling’s](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ffm/Lehrstuehle/Lehrstuhl-XII/dehling.html) 70th birthday.

2024

**12/2024:** I have been accepted into the program [Mentoring.UR](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/chancengleichheit/mentoring/staffel-2024/index.html)! I am eager to connect with my mentor and grow both personally and professionally through this experience. ✨

**10/2024:** Just wrapped up an inspiring three weeks at **UC Berkeley**, where I had the privilege of visiting [Bin Yu](https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu) and her team. My time there was filled with engaging talks, meaningful conversations, and the opportunity to connect with inspiring researchers. During my trip, I also had the pleasure of giving a talk at **UC Santa Cruz**, where I exchanged ideas and learned about the exciting work happening there. 🌍

**09/2024:** I am thrilled to share that I have been awarded **funding** through the **Graduate Center at the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation** ([bidt](https://www.bidt.digital)), an institute of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. This funding will support my work in advancing research on *From Data to Discovery in the Healthcare Information Age: Interpretable Machine Learning with Piecewise Constant Models*. A summary of my project can be found [here](https://www.bidt.digital/person/kata-vuk/).🌟

**08/2024:** It was wonderful to return to my home university for the [IMS World Congress](https://www.bernoulli-ims-worldcongress2024.org). I had the privilege of **presenting** in the "New Directions in Change-Point Analysis" session alongside esteemed colleagues Marie Huskova, Rebecca Killick, and Robert Lund. It was great to connect with attendees from around the globe and engage in a variety of fascinating talks and plenary sessions. The pre-meeting for young researchers was particularly enriching, with Remco van der Hofstad, Emmanuel Candes, and Susan Murphy sharing their insights on network science, AI, and digital health. 🌍

**07/2024:** Attending the **12th Grainau Workshop on Genetic Epidemiology** was a refreshing change from my usual conferences, where the focus is typically more technical. It was fascinating to engage with experts from the fields of medicine and epidemiology and to discuss how machine learning can be applied to genetic data analysis. 🧬 

**06/2024:** In the course **Fundamentals of Bioinformatics Analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq Data** at FAU, offered by the TRR 374, I had the opportunity to delve into the sequencing analysis techniques. 📈

**12/2023:** I gave a **talk** in the session "Time Series: Detecting Change-Points and Dependence" at the [CMStatistics](https://www.cmstatistics.org/CMStatistics2023/programme.php) Conference held at HTW Berlin. It was great to reconnect with former colleagues from Ruhr University Bochum! 

**10/2023:** It was a great pleasure for me to **speak** at the [R,KOM lecture series](https://www.r-kom.de/digit-r) on the topic ["Knocked Out by AI? Is Artificial Intelligence Taking Over in Business and Society?"](https://www.r-kom.de/w/-digit-r_13). Addressing such a wide and engaged audience was a refreshing experience for me. The panel discussion that followed was particularly insightful, offering a rich exchange of diverse perspectives on the potential and challenges AI presents in business and society.
