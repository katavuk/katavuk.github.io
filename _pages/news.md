It was wonderful to return to my home university for the [IMS World Congress](https://www.bernoulli-ims-worldcongress2024.org). I had the privilege of **presenting** in the "New Directions in Change-Point Analysis" session alongside esteemed colleagues Marie Huskova, Rebecca Killick, and Robert Lund. It was great to connect with attendees from around the globe and engage in a variety of fascinating talks and plenary sessions. The pre-meeting for young researchers was particularly enriching, with Remco van der Hofstad, Emmanuel Candes, and Susan Murphy sharing their insights on network science, AI, and digital health. üåç
