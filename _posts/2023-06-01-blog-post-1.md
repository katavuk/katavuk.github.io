I have started a new position as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Regensburg! Iâ€™ll be working at the Faculty of Informatics and Data Science in the Machine Learning Group led by Merle Behr. I am excited to contribute to this dynamic field and explore innovative approaches in statistical machine learning. 

I'm also looking forward to experiencing the beautiful city of Regensburg, which promises to be a wonderful place to live and work.
